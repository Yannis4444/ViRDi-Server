# Communication

The communication between clients and the server is handled using **gRPC**,
enabling efficient, bidirectional streaming and request-response interactions.

The actual proto file can be found [here](../virdi/grpc_service/protos/virdi.proto)

### **Whatâ€™s Covered in This Section?**
- **Overview of gRPC Services**: Explanation of how clients and the server communicate.
- **RPC Definitions**: Detailed breakdown of each service method.
- **Message Structures**: Explanation of the data exchanged between clients and the server.
- **Interaction Flows**: Diagrams illustrating the production and consumption processes.

This section serves as a reference for developers integrating with the system, providing insights into how resources are managed between clients and the server.

                Note left of Server: Server stops client when buffer is full
                Server --x Client: RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
            end
        end
    end
```

### OfferProduction

Clients use this RPC to offer a resource for production.
Opened once for each offered resource.

- The server registers the client as a possible producer.
- The server sends requests whenever it needs the resource.

**RPC Definition:**

```proto
rpc OfferProduction (ProductionOffer) returns (stream ProductionRequest);
```

**Flow:**

1. Client sends `ProductionOffer` to the server.
2. Server registers the client and opens a `ProductionRequest` stream.
3. Server sends `ProductionRequest` messages when it needs the offered resources.

---

### Produce

Clients use this RPC to stream resources to the server.
Opened once for each produced resource.

- The server requests production through the `ProductionRequest` stream in `OfferProduction`.
- The client continuously sends resources
- The server cancels the stream with `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` when its buffer is full.

**RPC Definition:**

```proto
rpc Produce (stream ResourceProduction) returns (ProductionResponse);
```

**Flow:**

1. Client sends an initial `ResourceProductionInitInfo`.
2. Client continuously sends `amount` updates.
3. Server aborts with `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` when the buffer is full.

## Consumption

```mermaid

    title Consumption
    participant Client
    participant Server
    Note right of Client: Client requests a resource for a consumer
    Client ->> Server: Consume(ConsumptionRequest)
    Note left of Server: Server opens resource stream
    Server -->> Client: stream ResourceConsumption

    loop Consumption Loop
        Note left of Server: Server sends resource
        Server ->> Client: ResourceConsumption(amount)
        break when buffer is full
            Note right of Client: Client stops stream when buffer is full
            Client --x Server: RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
        end
    end
```

---

### Consume

Clients use this RPC to request resources for a consumer.
Opened once for each consumer.

- Multiple streams can be opened for different resources and consumers.
- The server streams resources as long as available.
- The server cancels the stream with `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` when its buffer is full.

**RPC Definition:**

```proto
rpc Consume (ConsumptionRequest) returns (stream ResourceConsumption);
```

**Flow:**

1. Client requests a resource using `ConsumptionRequest`.
2. Server streams `ResourceConsumption` messages.
3. Client processes the resource until the buffer is full.
4. Client cancels the stream with `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`.

## Message Definitions

### ProductionOffer

```proto
message ProductionOffer {
  string resource_id = 1;
}
```

**Description:**
Sent by the client in `OfferProduction` to indicate which resource it can produce.

| Field         | Type     | Description                         |
|---------------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| `resource_id` | `string` | Identifier of the resource offered. |

---

### ProductionRequest

```proto
message ProductionRequest {
}
```
